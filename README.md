# MindSpace
MindSpace is a Mental Health Platform for School Students (K-12), designed to help teachers understand their students' emotional and mental well-being through real-time polls. It provides AI-generated suggestions (via the Gemini API) on how to structure lessons and manage workloads based on students' moods and feelings.
